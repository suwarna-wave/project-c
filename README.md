## **Features**

- **🔐 Log In:** Secure access to user accounts.
- **📝 Sign Up:** Easy registration for new users.
- **📄 Profile Management:** View user details and transaction history.
- **💸 Deposit:** Deposit funds into your account.
- **💳 Withdrawal:** Withdraw funds from your account.
- **🚪 Log Out:** Securely exit your account.

## **How to Run the Program**

To run this program, we recommend using the GCC compiler, though other compilers are also supported. Use the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile the Program:**

   ```bash
   gcc -o out main.c utils.c users.c transaction.c
   ```

   This command compiles and links the source code files (`main.c`, `utils.c`, `users.c`, and `transaction.c`) into an executable file named `out`. The `-o` flag specifies the output file, and GCC is used to compile the C programs.

2. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   ./out
   ```

   This command runs the compiled binary file in the current directory.

## **Our Approach**

We focused on three key principles to ensure the system is both user-friendly and maintainable:

1. **🎨 Minimal Design:** A clean and straightforward interface for ease of use.
2. **🔄 Reusability:** Implemented with small, easy-to-understand functions for efficient code reuse.
3. **🛠️ Maintainability:** Organized into multiple files for clarity and ease of updates.

## **Technical Details**

This project leverages advanced C programming concepts, including:

- **📂 File Handling:** Efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **🗂️ Multi-file System:** Clean separation of code across multiple files.
- **🏗️ Structures & Functions:** Organized code with clear data management.
- **📊 Arrays & Pointers:** Efficient data manipulation and memory management.

## **Compatibility Issues**

We encountered and overcame several challenges during development:

- **🛠️ IDE Compatibility:** Faced and resolved compilation errors across different IDEs (e.g., Code OSS, VIM, Code Blocks).
- **💻 Linux OS:** Major development on Linux, with some tricky configurations.
- **🎨 Design Elements:** Implemented color and design features, which presented unique challenges in C programming.
